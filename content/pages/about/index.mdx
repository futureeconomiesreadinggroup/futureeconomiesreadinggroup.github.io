This reading group will be meeting monthly by video through 2021.

What do post-market resource allocation strategies look like? What modes of production
are enabled by global communication networks? How do we build communities that resist
the exploitation of global capital? Can we create sustainable enterprises that
prioritize the interests of all stakeholders, including the planet, and grow them to
challenge the dominance of financial capital?

These are some of the questions we'll investigate in the Future Economies Reading Group.

We will also strive to build a community of people interested in learning more about,
joining, and organizing cooperatives. When available, we will invite speakers
knowledgable on particular topics.

Questions? Contact [Jason](mailto:jason.prado@gmail.com).
