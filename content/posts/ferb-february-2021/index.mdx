## Topics

While privately-owned corporations can raise capital by selling equity shares,
cooperatives are owned and governed by their stakeholdersâ€“not by absentee
shareholders. But cooperative enterprises require startup and operating capital
just like any other. How, then, can cooperatives acquire this needed capital
while maintaining their cooperative structure?

In the past three decades, the cooperative sector has innovated novel forms of
financing that open the door to forms of financing that function similarly to
equity financing. This month, we'll look at case studies and real structures
that cooperatives use in practice to raise funding.
