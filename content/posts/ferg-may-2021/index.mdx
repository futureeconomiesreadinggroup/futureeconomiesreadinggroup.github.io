## Topics

This month our reading selection and group conversation will be facilitated by
member [Monika Viktorova](https://twitter.com/mviktoro).

Our lives are shaped by social relations, not algorithms, but the rise of AI
algorithms has the potential to radically alter our society's relations of
production. Our workplaces, our governments, and even the face of the planet
itself are impacted by the use of AI.

AI companies have tended towards massive conglomeration. If you use an
AI-powered device, odds are it was created by one of the big five. Its models
were almost certainly trained on one of the three major cloud hosts. But it's
important for us to tease apart what is new about AI-powered economies and what
is the same old capitalism. Capital tended towards monopolization before AI, but
the the process of concentration has been accelerated by the investment of the
billions necessary to capture massive dataflows used to train AI and to finance
the construction of AI training datacenters.

What does it mean to be a tech worker? Isn't someone who works beside robots
everyday, who works with the implements of technology, a tech worker? What is
the potential for cross-industry solidarity between desk workers and the
logistics workers whose workflows are managed and optimized by AI algorithms?
